## Goal

Kupongo aims to "gamify" coupon collecting by allowing coupons to be placed
geographically on map and allow players to travel and collect them. Businesses
will benefit from the ability to track their collected coupons and get insights
on where their clients are geographically. Users will benefit from the
constant chance of collecting a coupon wherever they go and eventually
receive targeted coupons from their favorite brands.
